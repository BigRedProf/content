.SYNOPSIS
	Packs the NuGet packages into the shared local feed, for testing without publishing.

.DESCRIPTION
	Testing a package change across the BigRedProf repositories used to mean publishing a
	prerelease to nuget.org and waiting for it to index -- minutes per attempt, and a version
	number spent forever whether or not the change was any good.

	This packs into a folder feed the sibling repositories restore from instead. It is not a
	shortcut around packaging: it produces the real .nupkg, in Release, so what a consumer
	restores is what CI would have published. That matters here more than usual, because
	a real .nupkg is what a consumer restores, so packaging mistakes surface here rather
	than after publishing.

	Every pack gets a unique version. NuGet's global packages cache is keyed on id and version,
	so re-packing the same version silently changes nothing: the consumer keeps restoring the
	copy it already unpacked. A timestamp sidesteps that entirely rather than asking everyone to
	remember to clear caches.

.PARAMETER Version
	The version to pack. Defaults to <MinVerMinimumMajorMinor>.0-local.<timestamp>, so it tracks
	the release the repository is working toward.

.PARAMETER Feed
	The folder feed. Defaults to $env:BRP_LOCAL_FEED, then to .local-feed beside the repositories.
