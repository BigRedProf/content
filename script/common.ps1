BIGREDPROF COMMON POWERSHELL UTILITIES
===============================================================================

Canonical/source version:

	BigRedProf/foundation/templates/dotnet/script/common.ps1

Each repository contains its OWN COPY under:

	script/common.ps1

This is intentional. Build/developer tooling should be versioned with each
repository and updated deliberately.

These helpers are shared by the genuinely complex scripts — currently just
doctor, since this repository ships a library and has no container image to
build. Simple verbs (restore/build/test/verify/clean/pack) live directly in
Taskfile.yml — Task is the orchestration layer.

Keep this file small, boring, deterministic, and easy for humans and AI agents
to understand.

Check that the .env files are UTF-8, returning $true when they are usable.

Task's dotenv parser reads UTF-8 only. A UTF-16 file -- which is exactly what
Windows PowerShell 5.1's `>` and `>>` redirection produces -- fails to parse,
AND Task's error message ECHOES THE FILE'S CONTENTS. A .env.local holding a PAT
therefore leaks it to the console and into any captured log.

IMPORTANT: Task reads the dotenv files at startup, BEFORE it invokes any task,
so `task doctor` can never reach this check -- Task has already failed and
printed the file. This is why the check lives in common.ps1 and is called by
callers that run OUTSIDE Task (.codex/setup.ps1, and doctor.ps1 when it is
invoked directly as `pwsh -File script/doctor.ps1`). That direct invocation is
the escape hatch for exactly the situation where Task itself will not run.
