.SYNOPSIS
	Releases a version by tagging it and pushing the tag.

.DESCRIPTION
	Publishing is CI's job, and deliberately so: nothing local can push a package. What this
	does is create the `v*` tag that makes CI publish, which is the step that is easy to get
	wrong and impossible to take back.

	nuget.org versions are immutable and effectively permanent. Tagging the wrong commit, a
	stale main, a dirty tree, or a typo'd version cannot be undone by deleting the tag, because
	by then the package is public. So this checks all of that first, shows what it is about to
	do, and asks.

.PARAMETER Version
	The version to release, with or without the leading `v`: 0.9.0, v0.9.0, 0.9.0-rc.5.

.PARAMETER Yes
	Skip the confirmation. For non-interactive use; think before reaching for it.

.PARAMETER SkipVerify
	Skip `task verify`. CI runs it too, so this only trades a local minute for a slower
	discovery of the same failure -- after the tag exists.

	It does NOT skip the Release pack. That check exists because verify runs Debug while CI
	packs Release, so skipping it would remove the one guard covering the difference, which is
	the opposite of what someone skipping the tests needs.
